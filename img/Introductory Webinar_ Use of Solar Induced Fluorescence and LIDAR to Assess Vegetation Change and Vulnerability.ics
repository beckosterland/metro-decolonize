SUMMARY:GoToWebinar - Introductory Webinar: Use of Solar Induced Fluoresc
 ence and LIDAR to Assess Vegetation Change and Vulnerability
LOCATION:GoToWebinar - See conference call information below

DESCRIPTION:1. Click and join at the specified time and date:\nhttps://gl
 obal.gotowebinar.com/join/8146465681382343180/807954809\nNote: This link
  should not be shared with others\; it is unique to you.\n\nThis introdu
 ctory webinar will cover the fundamentals of Solar Induced Fluorescence 
 (SIF) and LIDAR\, their applications\, and an overview of different sate
 llite data sources that are openly available. In addition\, it will also
  include a step-by-step guide on how to access\, open\, and interpret SI
 F and LIDAR data.\n\nSIF is a relatively new emerging satellite product\
 , which provides information on photosynthetic activity versus NDVI\, wh
 ich is a  greenness index. It serves as a strong proxy to gross primary 
 production (GPP)\, capturing dynamic responses of vegetation to stressor
 s such as drought and temperature.\n\nLIDAR is a sensor system that illu
 minates a target and measures distance through the time taken for a puls
 e to reflect back to the sensor. LIDAR can be used to generate topograph
 y and vegetation height maps and retrieve digital elevation data necessa
 ry for flood modeling and vulnerability\, along with risk analysis. They
  are valuable datasets for post-disaster assessment of debris deposition
 \, vegetation loss\, and flooding.\n\nObjectives: By the end of this tra
 ining\, attendees will be able to understand the basic concepts of SIF a
 nd LIDAR sensors\, how to interpret the measurements\, and how they can 
 be used to address different applications. In addition\, attendees will 
 also be able to access\, open\, and analyze SIF and LIDAR data.\n\nAudie
 nce: Academia as well as local\, regional\, state\, federal\, and intern
 ational organizations interested in using satellite imagery to support a
 pplications related to vegetation studies and disasters.\n\nCourse Forma
 t: Four\, 2-hour Parts\n\nPrerequisite: Session 1 of our on-demand Funda
 mentals of Remote Sensing series\, or have equivalent experience (http:/
 /appliedsciences.nasa.gov//join-mission/training/english/fundamentals-re
 mote-sensing). Attendees that do not complete prerequisites may not be p
 roperly prepared for the pace during the training.\n\n
