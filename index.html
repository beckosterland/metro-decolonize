                            Ulrick Chérubin is remembered as a man and a mayor of “great righteousness”. Born in Haiti, he fled to Quebec, much like many other Haitian-Canadians during the Papa Doc dictatorship, in 1970. He settled in Trois Rivières, finishing studies in education. Four years later he moved to the town of Amos, Quebec, along the banks of the Rivière Harricana in Abitibi, a town where he would eventually become mayor for four consecutive terms. First elected in 1998, Ulrick Chérubin became the first black mayor in Quebecois history, in a town that was and still is predominantly white. When he visited Boston, MA in 2010, city councillors there declared January 2 to be Ulrick Chérubin Day in the city of Boston in honor of his visit. Adored by his constituents and fellow mayors all over Canada, Chérubin left a lasting mark on those who knew him. He received 73% of the vote in the final election of his career.

                            At a narrow point of the St. Lawrence River, a series of shelf-like drops on the riverbed create an impressive array of rapids that have long been an integral natural feature in the history and development of the area. Large standing waves of water continuously dip and dive and crash down, hindering the passage of large boats. Several man-made bypasses around what are known today as the Lachine Rapids, have been built since the 1820s. But the rapids, known in the Mohawk language (Kanienʼkéha) as <a href="https://kanienkeha.net/grammer/nouns/kahnawa/" target="_blank">Kahná:wa</a>, remain in the psyche of the city. Kahná:wa, one might notice is similar to the word Kahnawà:ke, the name for the First Nations Reserve located on the South Shore. Kahnawà:ke uses the root word of kahná:wa and adds the suffix to make into what translates to ‘on the rapids’. Perhaps the most hurtful of all, however, was the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway which effectively cut off Kahnawà:ke’s direct access to the shoreline, erasing generations of the river-based community’s livelihood. This disconnection with the natural surroundings has caused a certain disillusionment with the environment among the younger people of Kahnawà:ke. This topic is discussed further in a documentary produced by KahnawàkeTV in 2012, available at the link below. The naming of this station as Kahná:wa hopes to remind us of the forgotten natural areas that have played such a crucial part in the history of the city. The Metro Station is situated a few kilometers north of these famous rapids.

                            As a member of the Tobique First Nation, one of the six Maliseet Nations, Senator Sandra Lovelace Nicholas has worked tirelessly to push forward rights for indigenous women in Canada and around the world. She has been recognized with the Order of Canada and is <a href="https://kanienkeha.net/grammer/nouns/kahnawa/" target="_blank">the first indigenous woman appointed to the Canadian Senate</a>. She began her quest to spread positive change for her brothers and sisters when she challenged provisions of the Indian Act in 1977. Under these provisions, a woman who married a non-indigenous man was stripped of her ‘Indian Status’, but did not nullify the status if an indigenous man married a non-indigenous woman. These policies denied many indigenous women rights for equal access to land ownership, and often clashed with traditional matriarchal relations in these communities. She petitioned the United Nations for the abuses of the Canadian government on indigenous women, Sandra Lovelace v. Canada. In 1985, an entire section of the Indian Act relating to women’s marriage rights was scrapped, partially returning rights to many indigenous women. Today she continues to serve as a Senator and is recognized as part of the six women on the  The Feminist Alliance for International Action. an

                            Juanita Westmoreland-Traoré was born in Verdun in 1942, nearby to where Verdun Metro station would be built in 1978. Studying at Université de Montreal (1966) and then completing her doctorate in law at Univertsité de Paris, she would go on to become Québec’s first appointed black judge. She also became the first black Canadian to occupy the position as dean of a law school in Canada in 1996 at the University of Windsor. Though now retired, Juanita Westmoreland-Traoré continues to speak on issues of systemic racism in Quebec, and has called for the courts in Quebec to better represent the pluralistic society we have in Quebec today.

                            Born in 1802 in France to a mother who had been enslaved in the colony of St. Domingue, soon to become Haiti, Alexandre Dumas, through his excellent sense of prose literature and adventurous spirit, would go on to become one of the most popular authors in history.

Since his internment in the Pantheon in Paris, reserved for France’s most distinguished citizens, a reevaluation of his image in France’s colonial past, and how his popularity has maintained over the years. IN 1843 he published a shorter novel named “Georges” which follows the story of a Mauritian boy, “a half-French Mulatto, leaves Mauritius to be educated in France, and returns to revenge for the affronts he had suffered as a boy.” Dumas’s books are still read in schools all over the island of Montreal and are fully in stock at the nearby Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec Grande Bibliothèque located at the former Berri-UQAM station, and will be for years to come.

                            Mary Two-Axe Earley was an integral part of advancing women’s and indigenous rights in Canada. Though her challenges on sections of the Indian Act, “treaty rights have been reclaimed, post-secondary education has become a reality, health services secured and the wounds of a political injustice soothed”.  Like Sandra Lovelace Nicholas, she also was wronged by the section that discriminated against indigenous women who ‘married out’ of status.  
                            In 1929, Ms. Two-Axe Earley moved from the Kahnawà:ke reserve where she had grown up, to Brooklyn, New York, where a neighbourhood called “Little Caughnawaga” which housed mainly Mohawk steel workers, building the New York’s modern skyline. An interesting documentary on this neighbourhood and its history can be found at the link below. It was here that she met and married Edward Earley, a white man, which nullified her Indian Status. Upon returning to the Kahnawà:ke reserve she learned of this injustice and began a lifelong work to regain her rights. Her work ultimately culminated in the passing of Bill-31 in 1985, reinstating thousands of indigenous women under the Indian Act and returning their rights. Mary Two-Axe Earley was the first woman to have her rights reinstated. At the ceremony, Two-Axe Earley declared, “Now I’ll have legal rights again. After all these years, I’ll be legally entitled to live on the reserve, to own property, die and be buried with my own people.”
