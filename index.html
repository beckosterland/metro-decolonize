                            Ulrick Chérubin is remembered as a man and a mayor of “great righteousness”. Born in Haiti, he fled to Quebec, much like many other Haitian-Canadians during the Papa Doc dictatorship, in 1970. He settled in Trois Rivières, finishing studies in education. Four years later he moved to the town of Amos, Quebec, along the banks of the Rivière Harricana in Abitibi, a town where he would eventually become mayor for four consecutive terms. First elected in 1998, Ulrick Chérubin became the first black mayor in Quebecois history, in a town that was and still is predominantly white. When he visited Boston, MA in 2010, city councillors there declared January 2 to be Ulrick Chérubin Day in the city of Boston in honor of his visit. Adored by his constituents and fellow mayors all over Canada, Chérubin left a lasting mark on those who knew him. He received 73% of the vote in the final election of his career. He passed away at the age of 70 while still in office.

                            At a narrow point of the St. Lawrence River, a series of shelf-like drops on the riverbed create an impressive array of rapids that have long been an integral natural feature in the history and development of the area. Large standing waves of water continuously dip and dive and crash down, hindering the passage of large boats. Several man-made bypasses around what are known today as the Lachine Rapids, have been built since the 1820s. But the rapids, known in the Mohawk language (Kanienʼkéha) as Kahná:wa, remain in the psyche of the city. Kahná:wa, one might notice is similar to the word Kahnawà:ke, the name for the First Nations Reserve located on the South Shore. Kahnawà:ke uses the root word of kahná:wa and adds the suffix to make into what translates to ‘on the rapids’. Situated a few kilometers north of these famous rapids is what is currently known as Monk Station.

                            As a member of the Tobique First Nation, one of the six Maliseet Nations, Senator Sandra Lovelace Nicholas has worked tirelessly to push forward rights for indigenous women in Canada and around the world. She has been recognized with the Order of Canada and is the first indigenous woman appointed to the Canadian Senate. She began her quest to spread positive change for her brothers and sisters when she challenged provisions of the Indian Act in 1977. Under these provisions, a woman who married a non-indigenous man was stripped of her ‘Indian Status’, but did not nullify the status if an indigenous man married a non-indigenous woman. These policies denied many indigenous women rights for equal access to land ownership, and often clashed with traditional matriarchal relations in these communities. She petitioned the United Nations for the abuses of the Canadian government on indigenous women, Sandra Lovelace v. Canada. In 1985, an entire section of the Indian Act relating to women’s marriage rights was scraped, partially returning rights to many indigenous women. Today she continues to serve as a Senator and is recognized as part of the six women on the  The Feminist Alliance for International Action. an

                            Juanita Westmoreland-Traoré was born in Verdun in 1942, nearby to where Verdun Metro station would be built in 1978. Studying at Université de Montreal (1966) and then completing her doctorate in law at Univertsité de Paris, she would go on to become Québec’s first appointed black judge. She also became the first black Canadian to occupy the position as dean of a law school in Canada in 1996 at the University of Windsor. Though now retired, Juanita Westmoreland-Traoré continues to speak on issues of systemic racism in Quebec, and has called for the courts in Quebec to better represent the pluralistic society we have in Quebec today.
